// We'll show how pointers work in contrast to values with

// from the one in the calling function.
func zeroval(ival int) {
	ival = 0

// `zeroptr` in contrast has an `*int` parameter, meaning
// that it takes an `int` pointer. The `*iptr` code in the
// function body then _dereferences_ the pointer from its
// memory address to the current value at that address.
// Assigning a value to a dereferenced pointer changes the
// value at the referenced address.
