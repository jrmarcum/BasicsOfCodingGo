// language study on sytax and simplicity of the languages as far as number of lines of code and operations required
// to perform the same task, as well as compile and run speed combined.


// Some command-line tools, like the `go` tool or `git`
// have many *subcommands*, each with its own set of
// flags. For example, `go build` and `go get` are two
// different subcommands of the `go` tool.
// The `flag` package lets us easily define simple
// subcommands that have their own flags.
