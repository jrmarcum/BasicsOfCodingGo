// A _line filter_ is a common type of program that reads
// input on stdin, processes it, and then prints some
// derived result to stdout. `grep` and `sed` are common
// line filters.

// Here's an example line filter in Go that writes a
// capitalized version of all input text. You can use this
// pattern to write your own Go line filters.

	// Wrapping the unbuffered `os.Stdin` with a buffered
	// scanner gives us a convenient `Scan` method that
	// advances the scanner to the next token; which is
	// the next line in the default scanner.

		// from the input.
		ucl := strings.ToUpper(scanner.Text())

		// Write out the uppercased line.
